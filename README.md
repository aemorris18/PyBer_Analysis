# PyBer_Analysis
Matplotlib lesson 5
Pyber Challenge

Overview
Provide ride sharing data by city type and total weekly fares for each city type and lastly how data differ by city type.

Results
The following is ride sharing data by city type:
Urban area had the most rides at 1625
Suburban at 625 
Rural at 125.

The total weekly fares for each city type:
Urban again led with 1660-2500 per week
Suburban 720-1415 per week
Rural 67-505

Summary
Urban areas led the way for most drivers, rides and money per week. Suburban area came in second and Rural last. One challenge
for rural areas are more people own personal vehicles did this or lack of availability to rural area kept ridership down? 
Likely it is the combination and targeting rural areas for Holidays, Weekend events under the framework of safe rides, ie., 
donâ€™t drink and drive would be a way to increase rider ship as long as drivers were available as well. For the suburban areas
you could take the same path as with urban areas but also offer riders availability for special event in the urban areas. 
Urban module encompass all ideas for rural and suburban areas and could offer discounts for repeat users to increase ridesharing.
